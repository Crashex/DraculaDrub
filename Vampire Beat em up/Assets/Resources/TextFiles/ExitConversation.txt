Mayor|"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! You have gone too Far this time!"
Dracula|"You refused Tribute from me! You knew the stakes!"
Mayor|"Holy hell, you don't even know!"
Dracula|"Know what?!"
Mayor|"Take a look around you! What do you see!?"
Dracula|"I see a few children, many of which are critically injured..."
Dracula|"...Many of which look like they haven't had a peaceful rest in ages"
Mayor|"Go on..."
Dracula|"...I...How long were things like this?..."
Mayor|"A Century and counting..."
Dracula|"...A century..."
Dracula|Then just drops down to his knees... The Gravity of what happened just hitting him
Dracula|"...All those men I just-"
Mayor|"Didn't even spare a thought their way... Do you even know the Village of which you Provide?"
Dracula|"..."
Mayor|"How about the name of the Mayor? Was it my Father? My grandfather? Or even my Great Grandmother?"
Dracula|"The Role of Mayor passes generations?..."
Mayor|"You haven't left that Castle in so long you've fell out of touch... Tell me, what was your plan after all this?"
Dracula|"I... Was just going to..."
Mayor|"Wipe everyone out without even asking a question?"
Dracula|"...Yes, that was where my current thought was"
Mayor|"Did you even think of Why we had to refuse Tribute?"
Dracula|"Because you were sick of me..."
Mayor|"...Tradition dictates we are to send one of our best and brightest to your Castle to work under you."
Mayor|"However... Look around you, Even think back on those you slaughtered"
Mayor|"Years of Famine, war and lack of Leadership lead to our best, being no more than sick or injured"
Dracula|"...So When Carmilla told me..."
Mayor|"She was asking for you to meet with us to discuss a way to work out this disparity... But that ship left when covered yourself in the blood of the Villagers"
Dracula|"...I'm a monster... I... "
Mayor|"Aye... While I Agree wholeheartedly... It seems your eyes are open to the Reality before you..."
Dracula|"...I don't even know your names... Or any of the names of the Mayors before you, I just..."
Mayor|"Anthony, and unfortunately my Lord... Even if you snapped to before you eviserated us... As a Mayor, I have to think of the people... "
Dracula|"...Execution?"
Mayor|"...Who would that serve?"
Dracula|"?"
Mayor|"No... I have a different punishment for you."
Mayor|"Dracula, Lord Vlad, you are to be Exiled from this Village, never to return"
Mayor|"For the Countless Deaths you caused... It would be my pleasure to see you scream in bloody pain."
Mayor|"But we both know even if we hate you, your Castle's hosts all adore you."
Dracula|"Do they?..."
Mayor|"...It's funny, my great great grandmother spoke so highly of you in her journals"
Mayor|"Such a kind and considerate man... Even as a Lord, he wouldn't think lesser of an old Lady like me"
Mayor|"Tomorrow at Sundown, that is when you leave"
Dracula|"Anthony..."
Mayor|"If you refuse, we will have to treat you as a threat... Like we do right now."
Dracula|"...I accept, but why not now?..."
Mayor|"...The Sun's a-rising my boy, We both know your kind is weakened in the sunlight"
Dracula|"...You're too kind Anthony, way too kind"
Mayor|"...You should head back and pack up... Don't worry, we won't target your people. They're not to blame in this"
Dracula|"...Thank you, I... Will remember this day"
Dracula| Dracula then leaves without a further word.
Mayor:|"...And don't come back... For both of our Sakes... Farewell"
