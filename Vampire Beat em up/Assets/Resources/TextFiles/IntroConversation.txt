Dracula|"Carmilla, What news do you bring from the Village?"
Carmilla|"My lord, the Village has refused Tribute, they-"
Dracula|"WHAT!?"
Carmilla|"My lord-"
Dracula|"They Refused!? Then we will simply take the Tribute from them!"
Carmilla|"...Understood my lord, shall we be sending the Monsters?"
Dracula|"They believe themselves too big for their lord, so their Lord shall pay them a visit"
Carmilla|"My Lord, In all due respect-"
Dracula|"I know, you are furious at this as well, but I will show them their place"
Dracula| Dracula then Leaves the Throne room.
Carmilla|"This, cannot end well."
Carmilla|"...I hate to ask this of you, but I need you to keep an eye on his Lordship while he..."
Carmilla|"Listen, the Lord has lost his way, the only thing we can do now is to keep an eye on him"
Carmilla|"Where to find him? He's not so spry in his current state, I imagine he'd be at the front gates"
Carmilla|"Don't try to stop him, It'd be suicide"
Carmilla|"This is for our lords sake... Unfortunately"
